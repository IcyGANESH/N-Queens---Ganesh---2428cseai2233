# N-Queens Problem Solver

Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the N-Queens problem, a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Features

Solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.

Supports different board sizes (N values).

Displays solutions in a structured format.

Implemented using Python in Google Colab.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Google Colab (recommended for execution)

Running the Code

Open Google Colab.

Upload the provided .ipynb file to your Colab workspace.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the algorithm.


Output

The program will output all valid board configurations where queens are placed safely.
Example solution for N=4:

. Q . .
. . . Q
Q . . .
. . Q .
